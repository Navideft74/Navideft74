# My Django Projects

Welcome to my GitHub! This repository showcases a selection of my Django projects and experiments where I apply best practices in web development, explore modern tools, and occasionally integrate additional services (such as Firebase) to extend functionality.

## About Me

I'm a passionate web developer specializing in Python and the Django framework. I enjoy building scalable, secure, and maintainable web applications while constantly learning new techniques and incorporating AI-powered tools to enhance my workflow. Whether it's leveraging code completion aids or integrating cloud services for real-time features, I strive to create projects that are both innovative and robust.

## What I’m Working On

- **Dynamic Web Applications:**  
  Developing full-stack web apps using Django’s powerful ORM, built-in admin, and REST frameworks.
  
- **Real-Time Features:**  
  Experimenting with integrating Firebase for real-time updates, user authentication, and additional cloud functionalities while maintaining Django’s core business logic.
  
- **AI-Enhanced Development:**  
  Utilizing free AI tools like ChatGPT, Codeium, Kite, and others to learn, debug, and refactor my Django code. These tools help improve productivity and code quality.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend Framework:** Django, Django REST Framework
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with templating via Django)
- **Database:** SQLite (development) / PostgreSQL (production-ready)
- **Cloud & Realtime:** Firebase integration for authentication, analytics, or real-time data (where applicable)
- **Tools & AI:**  
  - **ChatGPT:** For learning and troubleshooting  
  - **Codeium / Kite:** For context-aware code completion  
  - **VS Code with IntelliCode:** For enhanced development and debugging experiences
